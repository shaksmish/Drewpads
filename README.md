# Drewpads
Repository of short JS programs

I am new to front-end programming and wanted to note everything I learn so that I can look back at the projects in future. 
To do this, I created Drewpads, my personal repository of small experiments in HTML, CSS and JS. As I progress in the courses, I will publish more porjects here im 2023.

Thanks for the read.

And now, time for me to get started! :)
