        <p> Hi, my name is Shalki. I am a Masters student in Sustainable Development at Utrecht University, a beautiful student town in the Netherlands. </p>
        <p> I live in Den haag with my fiance and absolutely love the beaches here and the vibe of the city. It's only been 3 months and I am still exploring the places and food myself. Hopefully, I get to cover all the musuems, explore all the international cuisine in the most international city in Netherlands :) </p>
        <p> Here are a few things that I have experienced about this place:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> When it comes to the local food here, there is no such thing as great Dutch food or it isn't loved by anyone honestly. </li>
        <li>But, luckily I love making Indian food, it is so rich in flavours that I can not live without it. I wish to share this food with the world.</li>
        <li>I am learning Dutch in an app called Duolingo and have crossed 55 days streak, meaning I practised for 50+ days straight -> consistency ;)</li>
        <li>If you live in the Netherlands, you know that cycling is embedded in the lives of the people. I went on several cycling adventures as a kid and I am finally able to do so much more of it here. Wohoo!</li>
    </ul>
